# Data Collector

This data collection toolset includes two Python scripts, a text file, and a ChromeDriver file. It automates the process of collecting and updating real estate data by managing IDs to avoid duplicates and ensuring comprehensive collection.

## Components

1. **FindIDForUpdate.py** - Identifies estate IDs that need data updates.
2. **getData.py** - Collects detailed data for each estate ID that requires updating.
3. **Completed.txt** - Tracks estate IDs that have already been processed to avoid duplicate collection.
4. **Need_Update.txt** - Temporarily stores estate IDs requiring updates for each collection cycle.

### Files Overview

#### FindIDForUpdate.py

This script checks for estate IDs that need updating and generates the `Need_Update.txt` file.

- **Input**: `Completed.txt` (list of estate IDs that have already been processed).
- **Output**: `Need_Update.txt` (list of estate IDs that require new data collection).
- **Possible Errors**: ChromeDriver compatibility issues. (different OS)

#### getData.py

This script collects detailed information for each estate ID listed in `Need_Update.txt`.

- **Input**: `Need_Update.txt` generated by `FindIDForUpdate.py`.
- **Output**: Data files stored under `Housing/<Date>`, where `<Date>` is the actual date of collection.
- **Possible Errors**: None identified yet.

## Automation and Error Handling

**Goal**: Implement a tool or program that verifies the completion status of `getData.py` and handles results based on its success or failure.

1. If `getData.py` completes successfully:
   - Merge IDs from `Need_Update.txt` into `Completed.txt`.
   - Delete `Need_Update.txt` to reset for the next collection round.

2. If `getData.py` encounters an error:
   - Rerun `getData.py` since it has measures in place to handle unexpected stops.
